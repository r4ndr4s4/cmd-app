          <p>I'm a full-stack developer focusing on the frontend.</p>
          <p>
            I started learning programming in elementary school, studied
            computer science in secondary school, and eventually earned my BSc
            in computer engineering. However, nothing I learned in school has
            been as exciting as what I taught myself: web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            My new personal site (this <del>site</del> app) is currently under development, and I'm also
            working on gathering the projects I can and want to publish, along
            with their code on GitHub.
