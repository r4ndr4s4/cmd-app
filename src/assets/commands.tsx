          I started learning programming in elementary school, studied computer
          science in secondary school, and eventually earned my BSc in computer
          engineering. However, nothing I learned in school has been as exciting
          as what I taught myself: web development.

          My new personal site is currently under development, and I'm also
          working on gathering the projects I can and want to publish, along
          with their code, here.
