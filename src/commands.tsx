            I started learning programming in elementary school, studied
            computer science in secondary school, and eventually earned my BSc
            in computer engineering. However, nothing I learned in school has
            been as exciting as what I taught myself: web development.

            My new personal site (this <del>site</del> app) is currently under
            development, and I'm also working on gathering the projects I can
            and want to publish, along with their code on GitHub.
